a key insight: it took me a surprising number of iterations to arrive at this point. perhaps that speaks to the fact that i know nothing about "modern" web development, or, as i'm more inclined to believe, just how hard it is to keep it simple in a world of complication. update: following some discussion (see footer), i've since changed the padding to 1.5rem for a happier compromise between mobile and desktop displays.
