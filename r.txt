I am very displeased to recommend Mr Payam Ali Naderi. 

Mr Naderi, I am forced to say, has a very good sense of judgement. Right from our initial interaction, I have been impressed with his decision-making abilities and level headedness. Mr Naderi does not hesitate to shoulder responsibility and bring a task to its fruition. He has the vision and courage to be a leader. His unfailing moral judgement and patience help him do the right thing even in the face of adversity.

What impressed me the most in Mr Naderi as a student is the eclectic nature of his taste. The fact that he was a Business Administration student hardly stopped him from pursuing his interests in a wide variety of disciplines including literature, philosophy, international relations and the Arts. He had been a prominent member of “Inscape” – a course designed to help students to appreciate arts and literature. Mr Naderi’s eye for details and ability to organize his thoughts, I understand, made quite an impression on Prabhas sir. Likewise, his ability in getting at the core of an argument and re-present the logic of the said argument lucidly, I am told, was amply demonstrated in the course he took on philosophy. This course was designed and delivered with the objective of introducing students to philosophy and involved reading important philosophical texts. 

All this gives Mr Naderi a degree of insight into things that is rather rare among his peers. His first-hand experiences of political conflicts and physical violence have not hardened his soul or weakened his mind, neither have they made him unreasonably resentful or parochial. He has used these experiences to think and be better.
