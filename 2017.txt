Avenue Supermarts Limited is an emerging national supermarket chain, with a strong focus on value-retailing. We opened our first store in Mumbai, Maharashtra in 2002.

Our strategy is to lead on price while investing to differentiate on assortment, geographic expansion and cost optimisation. Our business model is based on the concept of offering value retailing to our customers using the EDLC / EDLP (Everyday Low Cost/Everyday Low Price) strategy. It is based on offering low prices on an everyday basis. This is done by achieving low procurement and operational cost, rather than as special promotions limited to certain products or to a particular day, week or any other specific period in the year. Our stores are supported by IT and operational management systems specific to our business needs. These systems streamline many of our functions including procurement, sales, supply chain and inventory control processes and produce updated information to support our business, on a daily basis. As a result, we are able to procure our merchandise from our distribution centres or directly from our suppliers and manage our inventory levels efficiently to better respond to our customersâ€™ changing preferences and needs.
